## Navigation
When you click on a computer, you'll be taken to the Overview tab by default. This tab provides key information about the computer, lets you manage tags specific to it, and displays the primary user assigned to the device. From the Overview page, you can use the navigation tabs to access and manage other aspects of the computer.
