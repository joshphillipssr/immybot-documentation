# Deployments

Deployments are the central concept in ImmyBot. They define how computers "should be" configured and allow you to automate software installation, configuration, and maintenance across your environment.

## What are Deployments?

A deployment is a rule that specifies:

1. **What** should be deployed (software or task)
2. **Where** it should be deployed (target computer, user)
3. **How** it should be enforced (required, adhoc, or onboarding.)

    B -->|can be| F[Software]
    B -->|can be| G[Task]
    C -->|can be| I[Computers]
    C -->|can be| J[Users]

```

Think of deployments as similar to Group Policy Objects in Windows environments, but more powerful and flexible.

## Deployment Types

ImmyBot supports two types of deployments:

### Software Deployments

Software deployments install, update, or remove software applications. They can:

- Install a specific version of an application
- Always keep an application updated to the latest version
- Uninstall an application if it's found
- Configure application settings after installation

### Task Deployments

Task deployments run scripts or commands to configure settings or perform actions. They can:

- Configure Windows settings
- Join computers to a domain
- Create local user accounts
- Set up network configurations
- Perform custom maintenance actions

## Target Enforcement Types

The enforcement type determines how and when a deployment is applied:

### Required

Required deployments are automatically applied during maintenance sessions. They ensure that:

- Software is installed if missing
- Software is updated if outdated
- Tasks are run if they haven't been run successfully before
- Configurations are applied and maintained

Use Required for software and settings that should always be present on target computers.

### Onboarding

Onboarding deployments only run during the initial computer Onboarding process. They:

- Run once when a computer is first added to ImmyBot
- Don't run during regular maintenance
- Are ideal for initial configuration tasks

Use Onboarding for one-time setup tasks like computer naming, and domain joining.

:::info Onboarding can be skipped
While we do not recommend it, Onboarding can be skipped. ImmyBot will then run scheduled maintenance based on the Schedule applied to the PC.
Please note Schedules require an ImmyBot Standard or ImmyBot Forever plan
:::

### Ad Hoc

Ad Hoc deployments only run when explicitly triggered. They:

- Don't run automatically during maintenance
- Must be manually triggered by a technician
- Are useful for occasional or on-demand tasks

Use Ad Hoc for tasks that should only run when specifically needed, like cleanup scripts or diagnostic tools.

## Targeting

Deployments can target computers based on various criteria:

### Direct Targeting

- **Cross Tenant**: Apply to every computer in your ImmyBot instance
- **Single Tenant**: Apply to all computers in a specific tenant
- **Computer or Person**: Apply to a single computer or person

### Dynamic Targeting

- **Filter Scripts**: Use PowerShell scripts to dynamically determine eligibility
- **PSA Agreement Additions**: Use your PSA to push contract agreement additions such as a SentinelOne add on

### Exclusions

You can also define exclusions to prevent a deployment from applying to certain computers by creating a deployment that specifically excludes those endpoints and setting the **Software Should Be** to Ignored.

## Deployment Resolution

When multiple deployments apply to the same computer, ImmyBot uses a resolution process to determine the final configuration. This process considers:

For detailed information on how deployments are resolved, see [Deployment Resolution](/Documentation/Reference/terminology.md#deployment-resolution).

## Creating Deployments

To create a new deployment:

1. Navigate to **Deployments** in the left sidebar
2. Click **New** to create a new deployment
3. Configure the deployment settings:
   - Content type (Software or Task)
   - Enforcement type
   - Targets
   - Additional settings
4. Click **Create** to save the deployment

::: info Saving your deployments
Do not be afraid to save your deployments. They do not apply automatically. They only apply when you run a [maintenace session](/Documentation/CoreFeatures/maintenance-sessions).

For step-by-step instructions, see [Creating and Managing Deployments](/Documentation/HowToGuides/creating-managing-deployments.md).

## Recommended Deployments

ImmyBot includes several recommended deployments that provide a solid foundation for managing your endpoints:

- **Create Profile for Primary User**: Allows ImmyBot to set default browser and PDF editors
- **Microsoft 365 Apps**: Installs the apps the selected user is licensed for
- **Manufacturer Updates**: Installs the latest updates from Dell, HP, and Lenovo
- **Adobe Reader**: Installs and configures the latest version of Adobe Reader

For more information, see [Recommended Deployments](/Documentation/GettingStarted/recommended-deployments).

## Best Practices

### Targeting Strategy

- Start with smaller, specific targets before expanding to larger groups
- Use filter scripts for complex targeting scenarios
- Test deployments on a small group before applying to all computers

### Deployment Organization

- Group related deployments together
- Use tags to categorize deployments
- Document the purpose and scope of each deployment

### Testing and Validation

- Test deployments in a Windows Sandbox where available
- Monitor maintenance logs for deployment issues
- Regularly review and update deployments as needed
