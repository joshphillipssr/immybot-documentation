## Overview

SMTP settings allow you to specify SMTP settings per tenant.
We reccomened you set the Onboarding tenant's SMTP settings first, as that will be used by default if
another tenant doesn't have SMTP setttings set, and you're sending mainteance emails.

## Settings

1. Tenant selection - Select the tenant that these settings will apply to
2. Host - Input your SMTP host here
