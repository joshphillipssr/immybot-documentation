# Creating & Managing Users

::: warning
 We require all users to be authenticated through Azure. No personal accounts can be used. No "Local ImmyBot" accounts are possible
:::

This guide explains how to add and manage users in ImmyBot.

## User Authentication Methods

ImmyBot uses Azure AD/Entra ID for authentication:

1. **Azure AD/Entra ID Integration**: Required for all ImmyBot instances
2. **Self-Registration**: Allow users to request access (with admin approval)

## Adding Users via Self-Registration

Self-registration is one way to add users to ImmyBot:

1. Have the person navigate to your ImmyBot instance (e.g., `https://yourdomain.immy.bot`)
2. They will see a login screen where they can request access:

![User requesting access](/Documentation/HowToGuides/Request-Access.png))

3. As an administrator, you'll see a yellow notification indicator at the top of your screen
4. Click the notification to review and approve the access request:

5. Select the appropriate role for the user (see [User Roles and Security](/Documentation/Administration/user-roles.md) for details)
6. Click **Approve** to grant access

## Managing People and Users

In ImmyBot, there's an important distinction:
- **People** are added to the system first (either through self-registration or Azure AD)
- These people are then assigned as **users** with specific roles and permissions

To manage people and their user accounts:

1. Navigate to **Show more** > **People**
2. View the list of all people in your ImmyBot instance
3. Click on a person to edit their details:
   - Change their role
   - Adjust tenant access
   - Enable/disable account

## Best Practices

Follow these best practices for user management:

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Assign the minimum necessary permissions
2. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review user accounts and permissions
3. **Offboarding Process**: Disable accounts promptly when users leave
4. **Role-Based Access**: Use roles to manage permissions consistently
5. **Documentation**: Maintain documentation of who has access and why

## Next Steps

After adding users, you might want to explore:

- [User Roles and Security](/Documentation/Administration/user-roles.md) - Learn about user permissions and security
- [Tenant Management](/Documentation/Administration/tenant-management.md) - Configure tenant access for users
- [Azure AD/Entra ID Integration](/Documentation/Integrations/azure-graph-permissions-setup.md) - Configure Azure AD/Entra permissions
