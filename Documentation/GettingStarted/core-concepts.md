# Core Concepts

This guide explains the fundamental concepts of ImmyBot that you'll need to understand to use the platform effectively. Each concept builds on the previous ones to create a comprehensive automation system.

## Deployments

A deployment is a rule that specifies:

1. **What** should be deployed (software or task)
2. **Where** it should be deployed (target computer, user)
3. **How** it should be enforced (required, adhoc, or onboarding.)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Deployment] -->|Contains| B[Maintenance Item]
    A -->|Effects| C[Targets]
    A -->|Enforces| D[Enforcement Type]
    A -->|May Contain| E[Parameters]
    B -->|can be| F[Software]
    B -->|can be| G[Task]
    C -->|can be| I[Computers]
    C -->|can be| J[Users]

```

Think of deployments as similar to Group Policy Objects in Windows environments, but more powerful and flexible.


> **Example**: A deployment might specify that "All accounting computers should have QuickBooks 2023 installed."

## Maintenance Sessions

Maintenance Sessions are the mechanism through which ImmyBot applies deployments to computers. When a maintenance session runs, ImmyBot:

When a maintenance session runs, ImmyBot:

1. Identifies all deployments that apply to the computer
2. Determines the current state of the computer
3. Creates a plan to bring the computer into compliance
4. Executes that plan as a series of maintenance actions
5. Determines the current state of the computer to see if the deployments were successful
6. Reports on the results of the maintance session



```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Start Maintenance] --> B[Identify Deployments]
    B --> C[Check Current State]
    C --> D[Create Plan]
    D --> E[Execute Actions]
    E --> F[Check Current State]
    F --> G[Report Results]
```

Maintenance sessions can be triggered:
- Manually by a technician
- Automatically on a schedule
- Via API or integration

## Agents

The ImmyBot Agent is a lightweight service that runs on managed computers and communicates with the ImmyBot instance. The agent:

- Executes commands sent from the ImmyBot instance
- Reports computer information and status
- Manages software installations and configurations
- Runs scripts in various contexts (System, User, etc.)

There are two types of agents:
- **Full Agent**: Installed on managed computers, the full agent creates Ephemeral agents that do the actual work. Reccomended for all endpoints. See [Installation](/Documentation/GettingStarted/quick-start-guide.md) for more information.
- **Ephemeral Agent**: A temporary agent created dynamically for communicating to your ImmyBot instance. Does not require the Full Agent; integrations will be used to initiate these agents where possible if the full agent is not installed or not runnning.

## Tenants


In ImmyBot, tenants represent the organizations you manage. Each tenant:

- Has its own set of computers and users
- Can have tenant-specific deployments
- May have different settings and configurations

Tenants can be organized hierarchically, with parent-child relationships that allow for inheritance of certain settings and deployments.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[MSP Tenants] -->|Manages| B[Tenant A - Corp Office A]
    A -->|Manages| C[Tenant B - Corp Office B]
    C -->|parent of| D[Tenant C - Branch Office 1]
    C -->|parent of| E[Tenant D - Branch Office 2]
```


## Software

In ImmyBot, software is more than just an application. A software definition includes:
- **Versions**: Different versions of the software that can be deployed
- **Detection Methods**: Scripts that determine if the software is already installed
- **Installation Scripts**: Scripts that handle the installation process
- **Configuration Scripts**: Scripts that configure the software after installation

Software can be deployed in different ways:
- **Enforced**: Always installed and kept at a specific version
- **Removed**: Actively uninstalled if found

## Tasks

Tasks are scripts or commands that perform specific actions on computers. Unlike software deployments, tasks:
- Don't necessarily install anything
- Can be used for configuration, maintenance, or information gathering
- Can run in different contexts (System, User, Metascript, Cloud)

Tasks can be:
- **One-time**: Run once and complete
- **Recurring**: Run on a schedule

## Execution Contexts

Scripts in ImmyBot can run in different contexts, each with its own capabilities and limitations:

- **System Context**: Runs with SYSTEM privileges on the computer
- **User Context**: Runs in the context of a specific user **User MUST be logged in**
- **Metascript Context**: Runs on the ImmyBot server and can orchestrate actions across multiple computers
- **Cloud Context**: Runs in a cloud environment with access to cloud-specific APIs

Understanding these contexts is crucial for writing effective scripts and troubleshooting issues.

## Targets

Targets define which computers or users should receive a deployment. Targets can be based on:

- **Computer Groups**: Static or dynamic groups of computers
- **User Groups**: Groups of users, often synchronized from Azure AD
- **Filter Scripts**: PowerShell scripts that dynamically determine eligibility
- **Tenant**: All computers in a specific tenant

Targets allow for precise control over which computers receive which deployments, enabling you to create sophisticated deployment strategies.
