# Releases in 2022

## 0.54.7

Released 2023-01-04

### Improvements

- Improved error messages when the error is coming from an integration's API, such as the CW Automate API, CW Manage API, or CW Control ImmyBot extension API.
- Added manufacturer to duplicate agent table
- Added Device ID to the computer overview details

### Bug Fixes

Added `Split-Path` cmdlet as well as `$ActionId`, `$SessionId` and `$SessionGroupId` to the included variables
- Improved Ephemeral Agent connection speed
- Discontinued use of WMI CreateProcess which flags AV, specifically Windows Defender for Endpoint
- Made modifications to the light color theme to improve readability

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed several issues with the NCentral integration.  Should be more stable overall.

## 0.54.3

Released 2022-11-23

### Improvements

- Improved enqueueing of maintenance sessions based on priority.  Adhoc > Onboarding > Scheduled maintenance
- Removed service bus form options for CW Control as the service bus is now always used
- Added a health check to the CW Control integration to report unhealthy when the extension is not up to date
- Updated the connected indicator on the computer details page to have a yellow lightning bolt when the ephemeral agent is connected
- Scripts are now allowed to run for computers that have an ephemeral agent connected even if the agents all report disconnected
- Updated the batch actions on the tenant list page to include tenant preferences. e.g. You can now update tenant business hours in bulk
- Clicking "Attempt Identification Again" or "Rety x failed agents" on the identification tab now immediately triggers identification where before it would take up to 60 seconds

### Bug Fixes

- Made computer feature usage calculator no longer count computers that have zero agents
- Fixed a race condition in the Ephemeral Agent that would cause scripts to hang and sessions to timeout

## 0.54.2

Released 2022-11-17

### Improvements
- Improved our identification de-dupe logic to automatically associate re-installed agents to the correct computers
- Added more identification logs for some edge case scenarios to help with debugging
- Added onboarding text to dashboard underneath onboarding computers
- Slightly improved performance of preview/deploy functionality on the dashboard page
- Increased the width of the tag selector in the ImmyBot Installer form and on the computer details page

- Added missing times to the time dropdown for scheduling adhoc deployments
- Fixed descriptions on the maintenance task get/set/test script dropdowns
- Fixed some mobile styling issues with the navigation bar and on computer list page

## 0.54.1

Released 2022-11-14

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with CW Control syncs causing CW Control agents to re-sync into ImmyBot unnecessarily

## 0.54.0

Released 2022-11-11

### CW Control Updates

We added support for the breaking changes introduced in CW Control 22.9.
We addressed stability issues with Control crashing due to the ImmyBot extension.  On the Control integration form, make sure you check off the new options for using the Service Bus for better performance.

### Pending Identification Updates

Agent identification now has logging to help you find root causes for why some agents fail to have scripts run against them. View them in Computers -> Pending Identification -> Show Identification Logs

You can also see the identification logs for successfully identified agents under the Computer -> Agents tab.

We now utilize the serial numbers for devices that come from trusted manufacturers (currently Lenovo, Dell, and HP). If a computer already exists in ImmyBot for a trusted manufacturer, any additional agents with that computer's serial number will skip identification and automatically be associated.

### Improvements
- Fixed issue where Intellisense would throw null reference exception when completing variables
- Updated CW Control integration to support CW Control 22.9 (extension version 0.3.0)
- Added immy subscription information to billing details page
- Made subscription portal show within immy frontend instead of a link to chargebee
- Updated the default combined maintenance task script to leverage the latest function scripts in Immy. The new script is `Get-WindowsRegistryValue -Path "HKLM:\Software\Wow6432Node\MySoftwareVendor\MySoftware" -Name EnableFeature | Registry-ShouldBe -Value 1`
- License files are now downloaded before running a configuration task's test script during detection in case the script relies on the presence of the license file
- Added a new tenant preference "Exclude from Cross-Tenant Deployments and Schedules". When a tenant is excluded, all cross-tenant deployments and schedules targeting the tenant or its computers will not be applied when full maintenance is ran. This is particularly useful for Co-Managed IT situations that don't don't want your cross-tenant schedules or deployments.
- Improved startup time of instances in situations where there was a large number of recently added agents
- Added "Change Tenant" in batch actions for the computers table

## 0.53.12

Released 2022-11-09

### Bug Fixes

- Removed the ImmyBot Agent from the Tenant -> Mappings table
- Reduced metric reporter frequency to 30 minutes

## 0.53.11

Released 2022-10-20

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a null reference exception that was occurring when sending the maintenance session follow-up email
- Fixed a potential exception that could occur in the N-Central API
- Fixed an exception that occurred when trying to retrieve the online agents for a computer
- Fixed an uncommon issue where some dynamic version scripts were throwing a null reference exception
- Fixed an uncommon exception with ImmyBot Agent connection events that caused the event to not get saved
- Fixed an issue with syncing devices from CW Automate where it would potentially take a few minutes and block other requests
- Fixed an issue where some CW Control and N-Central agents were not automatically onboarding when they should
- Fixed issue where `Get-ImmyComputer -InventoryKeys` metascript was not auto populating the available keys
- Fixed an issue with incorrect breadcrumbs sometimes showing on the computer list page
- Added a missing debug log that indicates when an ImmyBot agent fails to provide inventory data
- Fixed a bug where we were dropping both dedupe markers over the same agent instead of different agents
- Fixed an issue with maintenance sessions reporting failed after re-running an action successfully
- Fixed an issue where loading the deployments list would throw a `ArgumentNullException`
- Fixed an issue with some Chocolatey and Ninite logs not showing up under a maintenance action's phases

## 0.53.10

Released 2022-10-05

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with displaying large software icon sizes on the Library -> Ordering page

## 0.53.9

Released 2022-10-05

### Improvements

- SVGs now render correctly when uploaded as software icons
- Increased some low timeout values on the ephemeral agent that were causing devices with slow network connections to fail
- Changed the Pending Identification tab to default sort descending by Date Added since the most recent machines are the ones we are usually looking for.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with the ImmyBot Agent connected/disconnected events not propagating for pc reboots and pending connectivity sessions
- Reduced likelyhood of `Output CircularBuffer has already over-run requested index` error in scripts
- Ephemeral Agent reconnection is now prevented upon receiving a 500 status code.  This was previously causing agents to stay running indefinitely.
- Fixed an issue on the system update page where the new releases dropdown was not stretching the width like the current release dropdown

## 0.53.8

Released 2022-9-22

### Improvements

- The "Suppress Reboots During Business Hours" flag no longer relies on  offline behavior.  If you are suppressing reboots during business hours and you run a session during business hours, then Immy will suppress reboots.  Business hours are now checked on every script execution, and the `RebootPreference` variable passed to scripts will also be updated to `Suppress` if it was not already set. We did this so that scripts that handle reboots can safely rely on this variable.
- The customer list on the Azure page no longer shows the MSP tenant as a selectable option in the Linked Tenant dropdown since the MSP tenant is mapped by default
- Refactored how we handle ImmyBot agent connected and disconnected events.  Instances that heavily utilize the ImmyBot agent will have significantly improved performance.
- The `Enable Automatic Onboarding` field on the PPKG form is now disabled and shows an alert if the onboarding preference is globally disabled or disabled for the selected tenant.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with loading the AzureAD module for metascripts.  This issue was causing all scripts that relied on AzureAD commands to fail.
- Fixed an issue where syncing the connected state of large numbers of ImmyBot agents would prevent other system jobs from being performed
- Fixed an issue where configuration tasks for already compliant software were executing at the very end of a maintenance session instead of in the expected order
- Fixed an issue where the default upgrade strategy was set to none instead of install over
- Fixed a permission issue where non-admins could not refresh the connectivity status of a computer
- Fixed an issue with downloading the ImmyAgent installer as an `.iso` file where the extension was incorrectly set to `.ppkg`
- Fixed an issue where software set to perform an update would incorrectly report compliant when the software did not specify an upgrade strategy and the upgrade was never performed.  The action will now fail and report "Upgrade failed: No Upgrade Strategy specified on the software."
- Fixed an issue with maintenance action execution ordering. If the currently executing action has dependencies, it will now immediately execute the dependencies instead of waiting until the end of the session.
- Fixed an issue with selecting a license on the deployment details page where the selected license was not shown upon refreshing

## 0.53.7

Released 2022-09-14

### Improvements

- Increased the timeout of the Ephemeral Agent's Ping RPC method from 1 second to 5 seconds.  1 second was too short and was unnecessarily causing scripts to fail on machines with high network latency.
- Added a warning message whenever the Ephemeral Agent's Ping RPC method takes over 1 second to respond to help identify machines with high network latency

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with schedules where updating a schedule from a single tenant to cross tenant would delete the schedule. This was happening due to a bug in a database constraint between schedules and tenants.
- Fixed an issue where the connectivity status button on the computer details page was not actually refreshing the agent's connectivity status
- Fixed an issue where repairing a software would trigger full maintenance

## 0.53.6

Released 2022-09-12

### Improvements

- Added `Set-ImmyDeviceId` cmdlet to be used during Inventory to keep the UUID of the machine up to date and prevent new computers from getting created when the UUID of the machine has changed due to a feature update.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the "Determine Desired Version" phase was running before the "Detect Installed Version" phase. "Detect Installed Version" needs to run first so we can pass the detected version to scripts that may rely on it when determining the desired version.
- Fixed an issue where dynamic versions were not properly installing dependent versions

## 0.53.5

Released 2022-09-09

### Bug Fixes

 - Fixed an issue from 0.53.4 where some code changes were unintentionally  included in the release which caused downloading the PPKG to fail

## 0.53.4

Released 2022-09-08

### Improvements

- For maintenance task test scripts, we made Immy tolerant of non-Boolean values by displaying a warning when non-Booleans are found on the pipeline along with helper text for preventing output pollution.
- Updated the ImmyBot Agent to support installing beta versions

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a scripting error that caused Immy to indicate there was no output when there was definitely output

## 0.53.3

Released 2022-08-30

### Software Test Script Changes

We now execute the software test script during the detection stage for software that have updates available.

**Before**, if a software needed to be upgraded, we would not run the software's test script in detection.  We would perform the upgrade and then run the test script afterwards.  However, if the test failed, the action would fail without any remediation.

**Now**, if a software needs to be upgraded, and it has a test script, the test script will run in detection. If the test script fails, then the repair strategy will be performed instead of the upgrade strategy.  The test script will still be run after the upgrade as it did before.

### General Improvements

- Updated the error text for schedule cron expressions to indicate that a schedule can run at most once per day.
- The ImmyBot Agent service sometimes throws an exception about a missing file `CliWrap.dll`, which causes the agent to bork.  When we encounter this exception, we now auto restart the service to resolve the issue.
- Improved the session log message "Detection stage failed: Software Action Id is not specified on the provided configuration task action" to include more information to help diagnose the issue.  It is usually because the deployment contains out-of-date data and needs to be updated.
- Improved the performance of loading the main computer list when sorting by computer name
- Test methods containing multiple outputs now return the result of ANDing those outputs together to compute the overall result.
- Updated Quick Deploy to allow you to choose a desired state. e.g. "Install, Uninstall, Update If Found, Ignore" or "Enforce, Monitor, Audit"
- Added detection of stuck/non-responsive jobs such as the agent identification job, which can initiate a self-restart of backend.
- Added reboot preference dropdown to quick deploy and override forms
- Moved several action columns on tables to the left side for consistency and best compatibility with mobile views.
- Added an option to schedules and adhoc-deplyoments to send detection emails even when all actions are compliant.  This is to allow users whose computers are already up to date to still receive a maintenance email.
- Updated the script list page and session log component to use the Monaco script editor
- Added the CW Automate icon to the main computer list. Clicking the icon opens up the computer in CW Automate.
- Added "Date Added" to the computer list and made it sortable
- Added a simple "new" tag on the computer list for computers that have been added to ImmyBot within the last 24 hours
- Added an 'X' button to easily remove linked tenants from integrations

### Bug Fixes

- After a task is created, the `Runs Against` property is now disabled. Changing this value after it is created can cause issues for deployments that are referencing it.
- Fixed an issue with Ephemeral Agent resilient script output logic that would fail to re-connect if the script had never had any output prior to connection loss. (Ex. SonicWall VPN installer script)
- Added missing triggered by text on the session details page when the session was triggered by a schedule or automatic onboarding
- Fixed a width issue on some dropdown buttons
- Fixed an issue with the integration client list re-sorting after you link/unlink a tenant

## 0.53.2

Released 2022-08-19

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an error that showed on the schedules list when a schedule existed that did not specify a time zone
- Fixed issue introduced in 0.53.1 where the current immy version stopped displaying in the sidebar
- Fixed issue introduced in 0.53.1 where the maintenance item ordering page broke
- Fixed issue introduced in 0.53.1 where showing/adding parameters on the maintenance task page broke
- Fixed an issue where monitor results were only showing the last line of output instead of all output
- Fixed an issue where monitor results were overflowing into other components
- Fixed an issue where re-running actions while showing action details would not displaying logs as they came in
- Fixed an issue introduced for instances that signed up after the release of 0.53.0 where identification would fail due to some missing database configurations

## 0.53.1 (un-published)

Released 2022-08-18

### Improvements
- Added a `Trigger Now` button to the Azure User Sync preference on the preferences page
- Added a description to the PPKG reset windows checkbox - "Will perform a reset of windows with the remove user data option"

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue with agent identification where users were seeing the following error - `Failed attempt to differentiate existing agent and pending agent: 42883: procedure sp_create_computer_from_agent(integer, uuid, boolean, text, text, text, unknown, boolean) does not exist POSITION: 6`
- Updated the alert of the person list page to match the available actions
- Fixed an issue where the software configuration task edit link was missing
- Fixed an issue where the branding logo alt text was still hardcoded to "Immense Networks" instead of the value provided by the branding
- Fixed an issue with cancelling a detection only session from the computer details page -> software tab.

- Added "Script Bytes Received" metric to system status page
- Fixed an issue with quick assign not setting the correct desired state when running the detection only session
- Made minor improvements to the getting started wizard
- Moved script details into script editor sidebar for convenience

### Bug Fixes

## 0.52.7

Released 2022-07-11

### Improvements


- The script list page now persists your filters after refreshing or leaving the page.
- Fixed width issues in the maintenance item column on the deployment list page
- Reduced required permissions for N-Central integration. See [the new N-Central integration docs](https://docs.immy.bot/ncentral-integration-setup.html) for details
- Added a new PowerShell cmdlet `Stop-ImmySession` that will cancel the maintenance session it is currently running in

### Bug Fixes


- Fixed some potential issues around agent connected/disconnected events
- Fixed potential N-Central exception with re-sending messages
- Fixed potential issue with 'missing' devices from N-Central due to possible filter contamination in N-Central

## 0.52.6

Released 2022-06-27

### Improvements


- Set the default install script for new software to the "Manual Install Script" and the upgrade strategy to "Install Over" whenever we don't have another specific install script to provide
- Set the default software installer type to "Installer File"
- Updated the example New-DynamicVersion script
- We now show a confirmation modal when choosing the "Wiped" option for resolving an agent identification conflict.
- You can now see Cloud Sessions from the main Sessions list!
- Added warnings when the ephemeral agent is failing to establish a connection to help users identify causes for failing script execution
- Fixed an issue with the detection stage stuck running when it fails to execute scripts in the beginning of the stage
- Improved timeline connected/disconnected events. There were edge cases that would show multiple connects/disconnects back to back.
- Removed timeline computer online/offline events to avoid confusion. These events were never actually based on a computer coming online or going offline. We simply emitted "online" when an agent connected and happened to be the only online agent. Similarly for "offline" events, we only emitted the event when an agent disconnected and all agents were offline. ImmyBot does not actively check whether a machine is online or offline. It only checks whether it has any connected agents to use. This concept will be further improved upon to help resolve issues with agents incorrectly reporting connected/disconnected.
- Removed link to software/task on deployment list since people are clicking it thinking it is the edit deployment link
- Moved the software/task selector back above the target selector on the deployment edit page
- Removed the media nav item since it's not actually useful

### Bug Fixes


- Moved "Update If Found" from underneath "Installed" to the same level as "Installed" for clarity. A software can be "installed, uninstalled, ignored, or updated if found"
- Fixed an issue with cloud task previews failing with "device offline"
- Fixed an issue where the ImmyBot agent update action would not run when the agent was offline
- Fixed an issue with the agent updates stage, onboarding stage, and resolution stage not honoring pending connectivity
- Fixed an issue where the resume and cancel session buttons were incorrectly showing for postponed sessions
- Fixed an issue with CW Control and CW Automate health error messages excluding important details that can help diagnose the problem
- Fixed an issue where we were not checking if a configuration task is actually marked as a configuration task. This resulted in tasks getting run when they should not have.

## 0.52.5

Released 2022-06-13

### N-Central Beta Updates


- Fixed an issue with exceptions that may occur inside the N-Central device-sync job causing memory to bloat
- You can now get registration tokens from the NCentral integration via new PSCmdlet `Get-NCentralRegistrationToken`

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/501dd3bc-d823-40a0-a307-000ec5185e6a)

### Other Improvements


- Under "Preferences", the description of the User Affinity Sync feature says it will run every 4 hours; this is incorrect. Verbiage was changed to indicate it will run every 24 hours.
- On the integration details page, a confirmation modal has been added when clicking the "Bulk create tenants..." button to prepare users that this will cause code execution for linked clients.
- Added more improvements to online/offline agent handling during maintenance sessions
- Updated the online/offline event receiver for CW Control to return immediately in an effort to close requests faster

## 0.52.4

Released 2022-05-31

### Improvements


- Removed unnecessary checkboxes from the Computers table on the "Edit Schedule" page
- Immy live chat now supports screenshare! Immy support can now request access to view your screen to help resolve issues faster.

### Bug Fixes


- Fixed an issue with the maintenance email actions requiring authentication

## 0.52.3

Released 2022-05-27

### Improvements


- ImmyAgents no longer need to see a valid board serial number in order to complete registration or rekey. Instead, ImmyAgent may fall back on and rely on an 'ImmyHWID' (Immy hardware id), when a board serial is not available. ImmyHWIDs are derived from CPU, BIOS, MOBO, GPU, and TPM information where available.
- Updated maintenance sessions to listen on agent connected/disconnected events instead of computer online/offline events which have faster responses and higher success rates
- When a new agent comes into ImmyBot, we now kick off the identification job immediately if it isn't already running in an effort to speed up identification
- Added session logs for dependencies indicating what they are for. e.g. `Software A depends on Software B → If not installed then install`.
- The actions in the maintenance email (Reboot Now, Update Now, and Postpone), now link to a form on the ImmyBot instance instead of linking directly to the backend api. The reason for this is because some spam filters will automatically follow links in an email, which has accidentally caused computer reboots. Moving the link to a form allows spam filters to no longer be able to trigger the action automatically.

### Bug Fixes


- Fixed an issue causing the computer details page to sometimes not load
- Fixed an issue with the ImmyAgent rekey request not being received
- Fixed an issue where `Get-ImmyComputer` was incorrectly reporting offline
- Fixed an issue where configuration file parameters were not being downloaded when the configuration task did not have any enabled scripts
- Fixed an issue with displaying the dependency badges on maintenance actions
- Fixed an issue with the schedule's day of week selector cutting off the last characters of "Wednesday"
- Fixed an issue with the CompareTo-ImmyBotVersion metascript
- Fixed an issue with some maintenance action start times showing "2021 years ago" instead of "Unavailable" when the action never started
- Bump Azure IoTHub packages to resolve some connection issues with the ImmyAgent

## 0.52.2

Released 2022-05-25

### Ephemeral Agent and Identification Improvements


- **ALL** scripts now run through the ephemeral agent, even during identification and computer de-dupe logic 🎉
- Additional exception information is now visible in Identification Failed tab, and in session output. This furthers insight for users to understand and fix potential reasons why the providers may have failed to run our agent.
  ![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/22b9d763-3a43-4403-8c01-70e020e3a303)
- Fixed an issue where the date was not being set correctly when adding a AgentIdentificationFailure log, leading the user to think this issue happened at the beginning of time!

### Other Improvements


- Added computer batch actions button on the tenants -> tenant details -> computers tab
- You can no longer create a schedule that executes within one hour of detection. This is a safety measure to help prevent reboots during business hours
- Added a checked to the schedules page for "Execute maintenance immediately after detection" to make it easier for those that do actually want to run execution after detection. When checked, you cannot set the execution time.
- The schedule list "Next Run" column now sorts correctly and also shows the browser's local "Next Run" time
- Added clarity to session logs when we are checking if an agent is online
- Quick deploy actions now use Offline Behavior: Apply on Connect
- Auto onboarding sessions now use Offline Behavior: Apply on Connect
- Computer list batch actions - Run Maintenance now uses Offline Behavior: Apply on Connect
- On the schedule details page, renamed "Target Category" to "Runs Against", and changed the options to "Computers" or "Cloud"

### Bug Fixes


- Fixed an issue with the primary user not being found when sending emails after an onboarding session
- Fixed an issue with checking off "Send follow-up email" on the onboarding form where it would not actually send the email
- Fixed an issue with unhealthy integration messages not showing the real error message
- Fixed an issue with unhealthy integration agents showing on the computer onboarding form
- Added missing script parameter `$LicenseFilePath` to detection scripts and configuration tasks

### Tags


You can now add tags to computers, and deploy software to tags! Manage tags under the settings link on the sidebar. Tags help in scenarios where workstations are shared by a variety of users and there is otherwise not a common property to target with a filter script.

Tags can be added to computers as a batch action on the computer list page.

## 0.50.8

Released 2022-03-04

### Onboarding Deployments


The **Onboarding** target type has been moved to a separate checkbox so that you can limit deployments to onboarding only AND use the target type filters.

### ImmyAgent Improvements


Updated internal infrastructure to utilize our new [extended verification code-signing certificate](https://www.digicert.com/signing/code-signing-certificates#EV-Code-Signing).

We currently sign:

1. ImmyAgent executable & MSI/EXE/PPKG Installers
2. Ephemeral Agent executable
3. Static PoSH run on computers

In addition to being more secure, this ensures our software is no-longer flagged by SmartScreen.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

Customers utilizing software such as ThreatLocker _MUST_ ensure our new certificate is whitelisted, as our new EV cert required "LLC" to be present on our CN and O.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/40220de1-d9f9-48fb-a39e-ebb791bd19fe)

## 0.50.7

Released 2022-02-25

### Maintenance Task Serial Execution


A maintenance task now has the option to "Execute Serially".

When checked, this maintenance task is guaranteed to only have one instance active at a time.

e.g. If three maintenance sessions have an action for a maintenance task that executes serially, then one session will execute the maintenance task while the other two wait for it to complete. Once the first completes, the second will execute. Once the second completes, the third will execute.

This is useful for maintenance tasks that rely on the state of subsequent executions.

### Other Improvements


- Added a `Status` and `Types` column to the CW Manage client list on the integration details page so you can easily filter your list to clients you want to create tenants for. Also made the `Linked Tenants` column filterable to "Linked" or "Not linked". The `Bulk create tenants for unassigned clients` is now `Bulk create tenants for filtered unassigned clients` and will only bulk create tenants for those visible rows matching the table filters.
- Added checks to ensure that the identification job is running properly

### Bug Fixes


- Fixed an error that was preventing the computer overview page from loading
- Fixed an issue with scripts running multiple times if you opened, closed, and re-opened a script editor

- Monitor maintenance tasks now run during execution except for previews which still run during detection

### Bug Fixes


- Fixed an issue with maintenance item specific schedules causing sessions to get stuck in created
- Fixed an issue with ephemeral agents not working correctly on Win7 x64-era machines
- Fixed issue with immy version not showing in footer

## 0.49.2

Released 2022-01-18

### Bug Fixes


- Fixed an issue where scripts run from the editor could throw the error: `An item with the same key has already been added. DebugPreference`

## 0.49.1

Released 2022-01-17

### Improvements


- The `$VerbosePreference` and `$DebugPreference` in a metascript now get passed down to the computer
- The top navbar on smaller screen sizes is now accessible from a collapsible button
- Added docs nav icon linking to https://docs.immy.bot
- Standardized task verbiage in the UI
- Added an additional task type filter on the task list page for "All, Computer, Cloud, Configuration"
- `Write-Progress` now appends to the session log output
- Added a health check for when the Hangfire server crashes and fails to restart
- Changed chocolatey actions to no longer use a hardcoded path `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\choco.exe`. We now retrieve the path by using `Get-Command choco -ErrorAction Stop | select -expand Source`. This ensures we can run chocolatey when it is not in installed in the default location (Looking at you `SyncroRMM`).
- Deployment filter scripts can now utilize function scripts
- Added license description field
- Improved performance of resolving azure group deployments

### Bug Fixes


- Resolved issue where computers running non-English version of Windows could not run any scripts. This issue also prevented successful identification for those computers.
- Resolved parameters not being passed to user-context scripts
- Fixed an issue with boolean deployment parameters not honoring `false`
- Fixed an issue with adhoc deployments not using the parameters specified on the page
- Fixed an issue with sessions showing passed when it should show partial passed
- Fixed issue where duplicating deployments did not copy over the parameter values
- Fixed issue with [ctrl-s] saving scripts from the editor
- Fixed a bug where software from deleted deployments were still showing in the assigned software tab
- Fixed a bug where the ephemeral agent retry logic was being ignored
- Fixed an issue with the logs panel failing to stay scrolled to the bottom
- Fixed an issue where inventory session logs were not showing up correctly
- Fixed an issue where needs attention actions were showing "unavailable" for the date time
- Fixed word wrapping on maintenance task parameter text
- Fixed a bug where deployments targeting "All computers / No Filter" would show "Workstations and portable devices" instead
- Fixed a bug where uploading files for global maintenance tasks would fail
- Fixed a bug where schedule and deployment provider specific target data was not loading properly

## 0.49.0

Released 2022-01-11

### Improved Performance


In this release, codenamed "Cheetah" we achieved a **20x** improvement in script execution performance through the use of WebSockets, Named Pipes, and removing code that is no longer necessary since the introduction of the Ephemeral Agent.

We also made restarting machines faster by using the new event driven Wait-ImmyComputer cmdlet when waiting for computers to reconnect after a reboot.

### Apply on Connect


#### Problem to solve

Computers that are offline never receive maintenance. These computers need a way to update when they miss their maintenance window.

#### Solution

You can now specify the offline behavior for computers on schedules and ad-hoc deployments.

When offline behavior is set to `Apply On Connect`, a session will get marked as ![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/5df28983-4e9d-455c-b1b3-21a8638b6e6a) when the device is offline. When the device comes online, the session will resume.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/e6b38fd2-0370-4e09-b75d-527867cfeedd)

Since devices can come online at anytime, the option to `Suppress Reboots During Business Hours` is checked by default.

If a device is offline before the detection stage, then it will run the detection stage when it comes online.

If a device is offline before the execution stage, then it will only run the execution stage when it comes online. It will not re-run detection.

Maintenance emails are only sent out once regardless if the device goes offline.

### Timeline


On the computer details overview tab, there is now a section called Timeline that
shows particular events that have occurred for the computer.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/90b4b265-8744-44cb-b3ce-47c2bd6ec0e0)

The events we are currently showing are:

1. Agent disconnected
1. Agent connected
1. Maintenance action started (only shows if the action required execution)
1. Maintenance action completed (only shows if the action required execution)

More events will be added in the future.

### Other Improvements


- Improved performance of determining desired state of deployments during maintenance
- Improved performance of some update queries
- Added a new metascript cmdlet `Wait-ImmyComputer` that returns as soon as a computer has connectivity
- Added & Updated Ephemeral Agent connection statistics in 'System Status' page to report data/data-rate metrics about the underlying Ephemeral Agent connection to the backend

### Bug Fixes


- Fixed an issue where software download scripts were timing out after 60 seconds if the script didn't specify its own timeout
- Fixed an issue where changes made to a configuration task parameters from the software page were not saving
- Fixed issues displaying incorrect text in the target type column on the deployment and schedule list pages
- Fixed a bug where you could not remove a software download script
- Fixed a bug with `Add-UriQueryParameter` where it did not accept array values or parse existing parameters
- Fixed an issue with Ephemeral Agent "end-of-stream" response exceptions resulting in termination of stage
- Fixed various issues with agent connection events and improved performance
- Fixed an issue where immy agent registrations could cause resource depletion in the backend's IoT service
- Fixed the timezone selector to show the region to differentiate the options
- Fixed a bug where dynamic versions could depend on itself and cause an infinite loop
