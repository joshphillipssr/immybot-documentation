```powershell
param(
  [Dropdown({@{Option1=1; Option2=2}})]
  $DropdownParam
 )
```
would not work but the following would
```powershell
param(
[Dropdown({@{ Option1=1; Option2=2}
})]$DropdownParam
)
```

#### Dynamic Parameters can be declared without `New-ParameterCollection`

```powershell
[CmdletBinding()]
param()
dynamicparam
{
    # Before
    New-ParameterCollection @(
        New-Parameter -Name FirstName -Mandatory
        New-Parameter -Name LastName -Mandatory
    )
}
process{}
```

```powershell

    if($FirstName -like "Darren*"){
        New-HelpText FirstNameWarning -HelpMessage "This guy is a jerk"
    }
    New-Parameter -Name LastName -Mandatory
    New-DateTimeParameter -Name StartDate -Mandatory -ValidateScript {
        if($_ -lt (Get-Date))

  - The virtual keyboard will remain visible until toggled off.
- Fixed an issue in remote control for some browsers (e.g. Firefox) that was causing a "Paste" button to constantly pop up.
  - This was due to new security restrictions introduced in some browsers.
  - These new restrictions prevent automatic background syncing of the clipboard.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/89cc5048-bc4c-4bf4-b642-7c17e2d808ca)

### Dynamic Integrations

- Added the capability for Dynamic integrations to specify a custom refresh interval for `GetAgents` job via the new `JobSettings` attribute over default period of 1 hour. ex: `[JobSettings(PeriodMinutes = 5)]`
- Fixed an issue where `Get-ProviderInfo` would fail to return `Configuration` form data for dynamic integrations.

### N-Central Integration

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/ba545e6b-5aa0-4c49-aa9b-b7259f56c34d)

### Improvements
- Minor UI padding improvements to computer list
- We no longer include the AzureAD module in every metascript's runspace. A script now has to call `Import-Module AzureAD` if it wants to use Azure AD commands. This reduces our memory footprint from 7MB to 4MB per script invocation.
- Improved the load time of the actions tab on the tenant details page
- Improved the load time of "This software has been recently used in X actions/deployments" data.

- Fixed an issue where filter scripts could not use `Get-ImmyAzureAuthHeader`
- Fixed an issue where `Get-ProviderInfo` would fail when targeting static integration types.
- `Get-ProviderInfo` now doesn't throw terminating errors for Integration types that don't exist to simplify usage patterns.
- Improved error handling and logging for the `Send-ImmyEmail` cmdlet
- Added the ability for `Add-UriQueryParameter` to remove existing query arguments that match input names to prevent arrays from being formed via `OverwriteParameters`.

- Fixed a bug preventing the maintenance action duration timer from incrementing.

## 0.64.0

Released 05/08/24

### Azure Domain Splitting

Azure customers can now be split into multiple Immy tenants from the Azure Customer Mapper

You can select one or more domains to link to an Immy tenant. Azure users whose UPNs match those domains will then be synced into the domain-linked Immy tenant instead of the default Immy tenant.

Splitting an Azure customer on domain will also automatically set the domain-linked Immy tenant as the "child" of the Azure customer's default Immy tenant, so that deployments targeting the parent can propagate to the domain-linked tenants

### Child Tenants

ImmyBot supports sites/location by allowing you to set a parent/child relation between tenants. You can set the parent tenant as a batch action on the tenant list page or from the edit tab on a tenant's details page.

### User Affinity Table

User Affinity results are now exposed under Reporting -> User Affinity and on the computer's details page.

### Deployment Page Changes

- Deployments for software linked to an integration can no longer specify configuration parameters.
- For software linked to a provider, the deployment configuration parameters are now inherited from the linked integration.
- This helps keep sensitive data like API keys and passwords private by not displaying the information in the deployment configuration parameters and instead storing the information in the integration.

### Deployment Migrations

- GLOBAL software linked to an integration can now automatically migrate data out of relevant deployments and into a new or existing integration.
- All GLOBAL software linked to integrations with the "Production" tag will be migrated.
- Added a new App Preference, "Allow Beta Integrations to Migrate Deployments".

### Improvements

- Any software can now be selected for install/uninstall in "Installation Prerequisites"
- Added parent-tenant-assignment batch action to the Tenants list
- Added parent-tenant column to the Tenants list
- Removed ability to deploy/preview cross-tenant computers on the deployment details page from MSP non-admin users that don't have the "can manage cross tenant deployments" permission
- Added an audit log that records when the application starts up
- Added an excel export button to the computer inventory scripts report table
- Increased the timeout for Expand-ZipFile from 1500 to 3600 seconds
- After updating a user, we now invalidate the cache for that user so the changes are propagated immediately
- Setting the primary user for a computer now shows up in the audit table. This includes the User Affinity Job and PPKGs that have a primary user set on the installer.
- Added Chassis Types to our initial inventory so newly created computers don't have the "Unknown Computer Type" badge
- Decreased PowerShell execution time by optimizing module loading
  UI improvements in line with what's desired by support and most useful to users
  -Alerts added as seen fit by support to better inform the user submitting a ticket.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue preventing software from being selected in "Installation Prerequisites"
- Fixed an issue with the dashboard table headers not loading correctly
- Fixed an issue where moving a computer that had an immy agent to another tenant would cause the agent to be deleted if you were to delete the original tenant the computer was assigned to
- Fixed a possible null reference exception that could occur when executing scripts over the CW Automate agent
- Fixed an issue preventing integration inventory scripts from running.
- Fixed an issue with CW Control target assignments saving the incorrect value for Control secondary groups

### Improvements

- Dynamic Integrations now allow you to implement ISupportsClientGrouping. This is useful when integrating with PSAs as clients can be grouped by what products they pay you for or the types of agreement they have.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where rekeyed/soft-deleted agents would throw an error whenever we would update their status to online (due to a unique constraint violation in our database)
- Fixed an issue where instances may not reliably automatically update when `Days to wait after update is available` was set to an interval longer than our typical release schedule.
- Fixed an issue that was causing new devices to fail during registration.
- The primary sidebar now automatically closes and opens when resizing between the desktop and mobile view
- Resumed sessions will now execute immediately if Offline Behavior is set to Apply On Connect and the execution time has already passed. Before, it would re-schedule execution at the same time the next day.

## 0.63.1

Released 04/15/24

### Computer Registry Tab

We have introduced a new tab on the computer details page that lets you remotely navigate the computer's registry and generate configuration tasks from selected values.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/d2846535-7df6-4f03-ba42-53ace07203c9)

More functionality is expected to get shipped with version 0.64.0, such as the ability to search and create/edit/delete registry entries.

### Improvements

- Added the ability to run user scripts from the computer terminal tab.
- Non-terminal errors/warnings coming from a Powershell host starting up will get pushed out as warnings in the console.
- Removed parallel execution of inventory scripts when run through scheduled sessions. This should improve performance when we have the maximum number of sessions running at once from schedules
- Depreciated User Action triggers has been fully removed to prevent confusion.
- When immy restarts, it will now re-enqueue already running sessions first, then pending sessions, and then finally created sessions

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where schedules targeting CW Control secondary groups become could become borked when a CW Control company was renamed
- Fixed an edge case issue where a scheduled job that's in "Pending Connectivity" status could run concurrently with a newly-created onboarding task of the agent is reinstalled with "automatic onboarding" enabled.
- Fixed an issue where a software could incorrectly have a prereq on itself
- Fixed a bug where it was possible to encounter a `Pipe is broken` exception while trying to execute scripts on a machine due to a possibility of the agent attempting to use a Powershell host that has faulted/exited recently before we could detect it.
- Fixed a bug that lead to User-context scripts to incorrectly use the System-context Environment variables (such as `TEMP`, `USERPROFILE`)

- "User Action Trigger" dropdown have been removed in the Script Editor

## 0.63.0

Released 04/02/24

### Automatic Agent Update Changes

The preference to enable automatic agent upgrades has been added back.

We no longer rely on MSI installers to automatically update the immy agent. Instead, we copy the ephemeral agent binary into "C:\Program Files (x86)\ImmyBot" whenever we detect that the agent binary is on an older version. Logic has been put in place to protect agent installations from breaking due to failed upgrades. Overall, the automatic updates should be more resilient.

### Notification Table Improvements

### Improvements

- Added a new reporting page called Computer Inventory Scripts that contains the latest results of all inventory scripts ran against computers
- Added more details to exceptions coming from integrations to help diagnose issues
- (Developer improvement) We have integrated new security testing into our code repository to help us detect potential vulnerabilities before they are released.
- The version text in the download agent button on the sidebar has been removed to avoid confusion. The agent version is still displayed in the modal that shows after clicking the button.
- We have exposed the immy.bot API under your-instance.immy.bot/swagger using the Swagger OpenAPI spec. https://swagger.io/specification/. Although officially this is not support, it may be useful if you are attempting to use our api in a 3rd party application.
- Edit Software: Advanced items with overridden (non-default) values are visible without expanding Advanced
- Edit Software: Selecting an Integration hides Version/Dynamic Versions UI to make it more obvious that the expectation is for the Integration to handle this logic.
- If a software is linked to an integration type but the deployment is missing the IntegrationId, but only one integration of that type exists, Immy will fall back to using that single integration.
- Updated ImmyBot references to immy.bot
- Removed deprecated IoT Hub code and dependencies from the latest version of the ImmyBot Agent

## 0.61.1

Released 02-08-24

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue in the ImmyAgent where it was attempting to connect over the IoT Hub even if the agent was never registered with the IoT Hub. This issue manifested in the agent never showing up in pending list.

### Improvements

- The latest version of the ImmyAgent removes references to the IoT Hub since it has been deprecated.
- For agents that experienced the bug with the IoT Hub mentioned above, they will now be able to successfully connect to Immy and show up in the pending list. Some agents will automatically get associated to their existing computers while some may need to be manually identified to the correct tenant.

## 0.60.0

Released 01-09-24

### Automatic ImmyBot Version Upgrades

When a new version of ImmyBot is released, you can now specify if you want to automatically update to that release after a specified amount of time. This behavior is configurable in preferences.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/9f9fafab-054b-4b22-98e4-f0343d1dea4d)

### Release Channel

The release channel determines what versions of ImmyBot are available to you. You can now choose which release channel you want to subscribe to.

The available channels are: Alpha, Beta, and General.

- **Alpha**: This channel contains releases that have passed development but may still be unstable. Only use this channel if it's absolutely necessary for a critical fix or to test brand new features and provide feedback.
- **Beta**: This channel is for early adopters and contains releases that are in the final rounds of testing. Use this channel to test new features and provide feedback.
- **General**: This channel contains releases that have been tested and are ready for general use. This is the recommended channel for stability.

All instances will default to the General channel.

You can change your channel on the System Update Page.

### ImmyBot is on .NET 8

The ImmyBot backend is now running .NET 8. While this doesn't introduce new features to end users, it does provide better performance and newer development features that benefit ImmyBot.

### Cross-Tenant Deployment Change Requests

A new application preference has been introduced that when enabled will require MSP non-admin users to submit change requests
when creating or updating cross-tenant deployments.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/73850538-f178-4b45-99c3-a47ee1ea748a)

On a per user basis, you can additionally opt-out of requiring change requests by assigning the user the following capability from the edit user page:

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/0bd8b8e5-89f6-4c5e-96ed-e024d345e209)

Change requests are submitted from the deployment details page in the same area you would normally create and update a deployment.

![image](https://immybot.blob.core.windows.net/release-media/9ba72b1a-0069-4bfa-a306-2399792aa072)

Once submitted, the change request can be reviewed in a read-only format. MSP non-admins will have the option to edit the change request, while MSP admins will have the ability to approve or deny the change request.
