## Windows Registry

It appears certain registry searches (particulary those related to detection) are searching
values stored in a database in immy instance. Need to verify. I believe this to be true because
if you select an endpointand the Registry tab, you can explore the endpoint registry straight from
immybot.

## Documentation Site Maintenance

Need to create a page outlining how to update this documentation site.

- Edit config.mts to make changes to the left side menu bar.
